# Assignment 1 - Supervised learning: kNN and Backpropagation


* Overview of the data 
* Explain why the down sampling of OCR data result in a more robust feature representation
* A short summary of how you implemented the kNN algorithm
* Explain how you handle draws in kNN
* Explain how you selected the best k for each data set using CV and the result, include the accuracy and images of your results for each data set
* A short summary of your backprop network implementation (single + multi)
* Present the result from the backprop training and how you reached the accuracy criteria for each dataset. Motivate your choice of network for each dataset, then explain how you selected good values for the learning rate
* Present the result, including images, of your example foa non-generalisable backprop solution. Exaplin why this example is non-generalisable
* A final discussion and conclution where you explain the difference between the performance of the different classifiers, Pros and cons etc.
